## What is this and how to use?

These are the full iron metallicity [Fe/H] posteriors for a sample of globular clusters (GCs) around M87 (NGC 4486). Each column is the posterior for
a GC and the column label is the ID for the GC. 

These files are large. If you want a more manageable file and do not need the posteriors, a machine-readable table of the summary statistics
are included with the Villaume et al. (2020) paper.
